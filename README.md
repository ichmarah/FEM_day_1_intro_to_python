# Python deep dive :snake:

## About

This repo includes small exercises in Python and my personal notes. Since we are in lockdown due to COVID-19, I decided to make use of this moment to pick-up Python again.

## Resources used

- I used [Nina Zakharenko's intro and intermediate course on Python](https://www.learnpython.dev/01-introduction/) as a start.
- Additionally, the [Youtube series 'Python for Beginners'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6) by Microsoft Developers also came in handy
