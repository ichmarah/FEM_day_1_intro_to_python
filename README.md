# Python deep dive :snake:

## About

This repo includes small exercises in Python and my personal notes. Since we are in lockdown due to COVID-19, I decided to make use of this moment to pick-up Python again.

## Resources used

- I used [Nina Zakharenko's intro and intermediate course on Python](https://www.learnpython.dev/01-introduction/) as a start.
- Additionally, the Youtube series by Microsoft Developers also came in handy:
  - ['Python for Beginners'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6)
  - ['More Python for Beginners'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYDnHi0u6_c&list=PLlrxD0HtieHiXd-nEby-TMCoUNwhbLUnj)
  - ['Even More Python for Beginners: Data Tools'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8OaGUYkHTE&list=PLlrxD0HtieHhHnCUVtR8UHS7eLl33zfJ-)
