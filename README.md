# Python deep dive ðŸ¤¿:snake: 

## About
This repo includes small exercises in Python and my personal notes. I have a basic knowledge of Python and since Amsterdam is currently on lock down due to COVID-19, I decided to deep dive into Python. I used [Nina Zakharenko's intro and intermediate course on Python](https://www.learnpython.dev/01-introduction/) as a start.
