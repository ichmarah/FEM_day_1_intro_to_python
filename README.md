# Python deep dive :snake:

## About

This repo includes small exercises in Python and my personal notes. I have a basic knowledge of Python and due to COVID-19 crisis, I decided to make use of this period to deep dive into Python.

## Resources used

- I used [Nina Zakharenko's intro and intermediate course on Python](https://www.learnpython.dev/01-introduction/) as a start.
- Additionally, the [Youtube series 'Python for Beginners'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6) by Microsoft Developers also came in handy
